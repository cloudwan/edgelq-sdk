  displayName: "CPU threshold alerting"
  description: >
    Monitors the least idle CPU core on each device, plus average idleness across all cores.
    Has enabled upper adaptive upper thresholds, enabling device to alert if CPU usage gets too
    low, which may be caused by some process that stopped working. Anomaly detectors enabled.
    One is monitoring intervals of 30 minutes, another one is monitoring intervals of 24 hours.
