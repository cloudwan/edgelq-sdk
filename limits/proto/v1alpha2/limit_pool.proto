// LimitPool represents a pool from which next LimitPool
// or final Limit instances are allocated from. LimitPool
// can either belong to a system (first pool, without parent) or
// organization (which got pool from system or parent organization).
// Size of child limit or limit pools must not exceed parent
// limit pool.
// LimitPool is in a way similar to Limit - it has scope and
// associated resource but:
// * LimitPool is non-final object. It cannot be used to
// allocate resources directly. It need child Limit first. So
// field with values in LimitPool are configured size, active
// size and reserved. Fields in Limit are configured limit,
// active limit and usage - they need different interpretation.
// * LimitPool is not regional, because it may feed limits in
// other regions. Limit has extra tracker in their final region
// for state synchronization purpose.
// Because LimitPool instances within one scope (system, organization)
// are managed by primary region of that scope, changes in them
// are done with only single transaction.
// LimitPool instances cannot be created or deleted. They cannot be
// also be modified (there are only some state fields controlled
// by system). LimitPools are created/modified along with
// PlanAssignment instances.
