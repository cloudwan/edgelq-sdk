// Policy is an object defining relation between multi-region service

// ought to be used for high-level resources like "Project" or "Organization"
// which form top elements in scopes. Policy then, attached to such a high level
// resource defines syncing policies for all kid resources and limits their
// geographical belonging (kid resources can belong only to the region allowed
// by a policy). Note: While Policy governs all resources under policy holder
// resource, policy holder resource itself is not subject to this Policy. This
// rule allows information about policy spread properly across regions and
// enables routing.
